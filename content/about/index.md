## A Brief Bio

![Polaroid picture of Alex Zhu reading something outside of Waterloo Campus Pizza.](pizza.jpg "Waterloo Campus Pizza, 2022")

**Hi! My name is Alex Zhu (he/him).** I'm studying Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo and will probably graduate as a member of the class of 2027. I grew up in the Ontario GTA, doing a large variety of things like playing tennis, running a YouTube channel, making podcasts and music, debating competitively, and playing video games a bit too competitively.

At some point I became known online as *probablyalex* and **the duck you see plastered across this website**. Later down the line I decided to study software. Right now, I consider myself to be a:
- **Frisbee Player** (intramurals) :flying_disc:
- **Skateboarder** (navy blue pennyboard for nearly a decade) :skateboard:
- **Star Wars Fan** (Andor was an incredible feat of filmmaking) :star:
- **Leafs Fan** (they just keep giving me hope every year) :hockey:
- **Casual Rapper and Producer** (somewhere hidden in the deep depths of SoundCloud rap) :microphone:
- **AYCE Sushi Lover** (bent over, staggering out of the sushi spots) :sushi:
- **and a Laptop Sticker Collector** (there's a method behind the madness I swear) :laptop:

Who will I become in the future? Only time will tell.
