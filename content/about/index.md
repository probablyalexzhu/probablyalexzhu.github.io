Hi, I'm Alex.

I'm a Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo, specializing in Human-Computer Interaction. I'm building a new type of AI platform to protect against generative AI threats at [Reken](https://reken.ai/) in the Bay Area, shipped workflow automation features at [Shopify](https://shopify.com/) that were prominently featured in [Editions Winter '26](https://www.shopify.com/editions/winter2026#sidekick), and worked on early-stage product at [Swift](https://www.runswiftapp.com/). I'm also one of North America's top-ranked competitive debaters and led Waterloo's first team to [break](https://youtu.be/U9lADym0tlc?t=1581) at the World Championship since 1991.

I wrote about how I think about work, motivation, and discipline [here](/blog/rolling-downhill/).

I'm graduating in 2027 and looking for my next challenge; feel free to [reach out](https://linkedin.com/in/probablyalexzhu/).
