## Hi, I'm Alex! üëãüê§

I‚Äôm a Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I like to think of myself as being flexible and able to thrive in many contexts, having developed skills from exploring a wide range of interests. **My goal is to combine these skills, such as coding and communicating, to solve real-world issues through technology.** I learn quickly and work well in teams and am interested in flexible roles where I can be creative and leverage my wide skill set.

I care about doing meaningful ethical work for the world. Other than coding, I love filmmaking, reading (philosophy, psychology, and sci-fi), competitive debating, and tennis. Feel free to reach out about anything!

A jack of all trades is a master of none, but often times better than a master of one.
