## Hi, I'm Alex! üëãüê§

I'm a Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo (graduating in 2027), specializing in Human-Computer Interaction. I love working at the intersection of people and technology; whether that's designing intuitive systems, debating ideas, or experimenting with creative projects.

I bring curiosity, collaboration, and reflection to everything I do. In teams, I contribute energy and thoughtful feedback, while also taking ownership of my work. I balance creativity with attention to detail, and I'm always looking for new ways to learn and grow.

Beyond coding, I'm passionate about filmmaking, philosophy, psychology, and sci-fi literature, as well as competitive debating and rock climbing. What ties these together is a drive to think critically, tell stories, and push myself in different ways.

**If any of this resonates with you, I'd love to connect!**

A jack of all trades is a master of none, but often times better than a master of one.
