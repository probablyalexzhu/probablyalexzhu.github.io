## Hi! My name is Alex Zhu (he/him).

Hello! I‚Äôm a Software Engineering student at UWaterloo. I like to think of myself as a coder and communicator: my goal is to lead driven teams to solve real-world issues through technology.

I grew up in the Ontario GTA, doing a large variety of things like playing tennis, running a YouTube channel, making podcasts and music, and debating competitively.

At some point I became known online as *probablyalex* and **the duck you see plastered across this website**. Later down the line I decided to study software. Right now, I consider myself to be a:
- **Varsity Debater** üó£Ô∏è
- **Intramural Frisbee Player** :flying_disc:
- **and a Laptop Sticker Collector** (there's a method behind the madness I swear) :laptop:

Who will I become in the future? *Only time will tell.*
