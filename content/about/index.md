## Hi! My name is Alex Zhu (he/him).

I'm studying Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo and will probably graduate as a member of the class of 2027.

I grew up in the Ontario GTA, doing a large variety of things like playing tennis, running a YouTube channel, making podcasts and music, and debating competitively.

At some point I became known online as *probablyalex* and **the duck you see plastered across this website**. Later down the line I decided to study software. Right now, I consider myself to be a:
- **Frisbee Player** (intramurals) :flying_disc:
- **Debater** (probably will be one for life) üó£Ô∏è
- **Skateboarder** (navy blue pennyboard for nearly a decade) :skateboard:
- **Sci-Fi Fan** (Star Wars: Andor was an incredible feat of filmmaking) üåå
- **Leafs Fan** (they just keep giving me hope every year) :hockey:
- **Casual Rapper and Producer** (somewhere hidden in the deep depths of SoundCloud rap) :microphone:
- **and a Laptop Sticker Collector** (there's a method behind the madness I swear) :laptop:

Who will I become in the future? *Only time will tell.*
