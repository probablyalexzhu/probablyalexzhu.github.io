## Hi, I'm Alex! 👋🐤

I’m a Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I like to think of myself as being able to thrive in many contexts, having developed skills from exploring a wide range of interests like coding and debating. My goal is to combine these skills to solve real-world issues through technology. **I learn quickly and work well in teams and am interested in flexible roles where I can be creative and leverage my wide skill set.**

I care about doing meaningful ethical work for the world. Other than coding, I love filmmaking, reading (philosophy, psychology, and sci-fi), competitive debating, and tennis.

**If any of this resonates with you, please reach out!**

A jack of all trades is a master of none, but often times better than a master of one.
