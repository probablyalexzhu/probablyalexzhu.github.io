## A Brief Bio

![Polaroid picture of Alex Zhu reading something outside of Waterloo Campus Pizza.](pizza.jpg "Waterloo Campus Pizza, 2022")

Hi! My name is Alex Zhu. I'm studying Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo and will probably graduate as a member of the class of 2027. I grew up in the Ontario GTA, doing a large variety of things like playing tennis, running a YouTube channel, making podcasts and music, debating competitively, and playing video games a bit too competitively. At some point I became known online as "probablyalex" and the duck you see plastered across this website, and later down the line I decided to study software. Right now, I consider myself to be a:
- Frisbee player (intramurals) :flying_disc:
- Skateboarder (navy blue pennyboard for nearly a decade) :skateboard:
- Star Wars fan (Andor was an incredible feat of filmmaking) :star:
- Casual Rapper and producer (somewhere hidden in the deep depths of SoundCloud rap) :microphone:
- AYCE sushi lover (bent over, staggering out of the sushi spots) :sushi:
- and a laptop sticker collector (there's a method behind the madness I swear) :laptop:
