## Hi! My name is Alex Zhu (he/him).

A jack of all trades is a master of none, but often times better than a master of one.
{{< /alert >}}

Iâ€™m a **Software Engineering** student at the University of Waterloo. I like to think of myself as being flexible and able to thrive in many contexts, having developed skills from exploring a wide range of interests. My goal is to combine these skills, such as coding and communicating, to solve real-world issues through technology.

I care about doing meaningful, ethical work for the world. Other than coding, I love reading (philosophy, psychology, and sci-fi), competitive debating, tennis, and producing music. Feel free to reach out any way about anything!
