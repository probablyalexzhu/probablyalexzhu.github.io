I wanted to share a few lessons I learned during this co-op search that aren't immediately obvious: 

## Application Process ðŸ§³
1. Applications that require **special action** stated in the job description, e.g. send us an email w/ xyz text, have a much higher chance for an interview if you do it. A lot of potential applicants miss it or don't bother.
2. A **generalized, one-size-fits-all** cover letter doesnâ€™t work too well for any type of company. Etiher don't write one, or customize adequately.
3. **Ask past co-ops** about their experience at the company and the interview questions they remember to help you prepare. Then, practice your answers.
## Interview Process ðŸ¤©
4. This one's from debate: before your interview, do some **voice warmups**. Be energetic, excited, and ready to talk slowly and clearly.
5. During the interview, be confident and remember to communicate well even during technical interviews. Start broad, but make sure to also provide lots of specific details to show expertise. Strike the balance between **overly humble** and cocky, both are instant killers of your chances at a successful interview.
6. What are the **weaknesses** on your resume that might give the interviewer reservations about hiring you? Quell them in the interview.
7. After the interview, send a **personalized and genuine follow-up email** referring to interview details and why youâ€™re a good fit.

Remember to have faith that things will work out if you continue to create your own luck. Hopefully these tips help you out!
