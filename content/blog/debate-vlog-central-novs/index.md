Last weekend, The UW Debate Society went to McGill Canadian Central Novice Championship 2023 and had a great time! When I woke up at 5 AM for the tournameent, I thought to myself "vlogging this trip would be cool", and so now this video exists. I had a great time filming it and tapping into my video production skills, and I hope you enjoy this inside look at how debate tournaments work.
