I spent the winter break in Vietnam competing at the World Universities Debating Championship 2024, and also filmed a vlog for it! It was an incredibly fun trip, so fun that at times I was living too much in the moment to film. Still, I think I did a decent job of portraying the vibes of the trip overall. I am incredibly grateful to have gotten to compete at this event, and I hope you enjoy the vlog!
