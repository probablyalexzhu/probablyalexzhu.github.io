The University of Waterloo Debate Society had the incredible opportunity of competing at the Panama World Universities Debating Championship 2025. Just as last time for Vietnam, we also filmed a vlog for it! It was an incredibly fun and enjoyable trip; enjoy the REALLY LONG but REALLY GREAT vlog/movie at this point!

Sorry that this came out late, it was a lot of footage and I couldn't find time during my school term to finish it, but I have edited it now in one sitting as soon as I could before the next term begins (1 day to edit 43 minutes of content!). Even though it may be slightly unpolished, I think this vlog features a lot of amazing moments of the debate community, especially within CUSID, and I'm super excited to share it with everyone at last. **The debate community would benefit greatly from more recording and treasuring of its moments**; I'm not even sure if I've seen other recordings of the break announcement or grand finals walkouts. Hopefully this vlog is a contribution to the community that highlights the value of recording these great times.
