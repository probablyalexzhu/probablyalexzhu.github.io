As a part of CS 348, Introduction to Database Management, we had the option to create a project using a database. We created Formula 1 SQL, a data-retrieval app to give insights from a downloaded F1 database. It has seven functionalities, optimized with indexing and caching, and other fancy features. All of this is explained in the demo video, which you can watch here!
