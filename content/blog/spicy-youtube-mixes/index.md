I really enjoyed studying with some YouTube mixes this term. I discovered a lot of new genres (namely UK Garage, Jungle, DnB) and incredible tracks, thanks to the passionate curation and mixing these amazing YouTubers are providing. I found they helped with focus and energy more than any energy drink could, as the seamless transitions kept me engaged, and I didn't have to worry about what the next song would/should be and go fiddle around in Spotify.

Here are some of my favourite mixes/albums for you to enjoy:

"I'm a delivery man and I've been bumpin this all week. Feeling like I'm speed running a video game."
