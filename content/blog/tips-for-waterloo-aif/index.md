If you implement these three tips, you will increase your chances of being accepted. Disclaimer: I am not involved in the application process; these are my best guesses as to how you can succeed as an applicant to Waterloo.

### 1. Understand the Application Process üß†
Read Director of Admissions for Waterloo Engineering William Bishop's blog https://theroadtoengineering.com/. **If you don't know the rules of the game, you probably won't play it well!** Know how AIFs are scored and how you can maximize your chances of getting in.

### 2. Research Features and Explain How You'll Use Them üîç
Research the university's **specific** positive features and write about how **you** would **specifically** fit into those features. For example, you could write about UWaterloo's co-op program, but *what exactly about it is better than other universities, how exactly would you take advantage of the program, and what would you offer the university in return as a member of the co-op program?*

Answering these questions show that you really know what you want, and advertises what you offer to the university.

### 3. Use the Branding Guidelinesü™û
Choose some character traits that you demonstrate well which align with Waterloo's branding guidelines. Highlight those parts of you, illustrating how you fit into Waterloo from a character perspective. **If you can match what Waterloo wants its brand to be like, you're sure to be accepted.**
