[{"content":"A Brief Bio # Waterloo Campus Pizza, 2022 Hi! My name is Alex Zhu. I\u0026rsquo;m studying Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo and will probably graduate as a member of the class of 2027. I grew up in the Ontario GTA, doing a large variety of things like playing tennis, running a YouTube channel, making podcasts and music, debating competitively, and playing video games a bit too competitively. At some point I became known online as \u0026ldquo;probablyalex\u0026rdquo; and the duck you see plastered across this website, and later down the line I decided to study software. Right now, I consider myself to be a:\nFrisbee player (intramurals) ü•è Skateboarder (navy blue pennyboard for nearly a decade) üõπ Star Wars fan (Andor was an incredible feat of filmmaking) ‚≠ê Casual Rapper and producer (somewhere hidden in the deep depths of SoundCloud rap) üé§ AYCE sushi lover (bent over, staggering out of the sushi spots) üç£ and a laptop sticker collector (there\u0026rsquo;s a method behind the madness I swear) üíª ","date":"December 4, 2022","permalink":"/about/","section":"Welcome to Congo! üéâ","summary":"Hi!

This is about why I want to blog, and why you should read my blog. We should be reader and writer ‚ô•Ô∏è\nWanderer Above The Sea of Clouds. One of my favourite paintings, symbolically Who? # I\u0026rsquo;m Alex Zhu, a software engineering student in SE \u0026lsquo;27 at UWaterloo. I grew up in the Ontario GTA and did a variety of activities, never settling on one thing. Random fact, but this isn\u0026rsquo;t my first blog. The first blog I wrote for was on the website I made for my Clash of Clans clan, Derp Kingdom, during my childhood. This blog is one of my latest projects that I want to put a significant chunk of time into.\nI hope to write for you, fellow peers and journeyers in the tech field. But hopefully I never meet you in real life, because then I would have a lot of explaining to do about this website.\nWhy? # I want to teach others. I don\u0026rsquo;t have a lot to share, but if we all share the little that we know, the world would be quite a bit better. Every person who replies on StackOverflow is someone\u0026rsquo;s GOAT. I hope my posts can provide the tiniest glimpse into my mind, and maybe something in there provides some value to you. I really want to hear from you! If you ever have beef with any of my ideas, feel free to send me an email and I\u0026rsquo;ll probably reply, and I\u0026rsquo;ll also try to get comments set up on here.\nWhat? # I plan on blogging about my thoughts on life related to self-improvement and projects I work on as a software engineering student. I feel like a lot of stuff goes on up here, and I\u0026rsquo;m dying to share some of it with others. No guarantees that it\u0026rsquo;ll be any good for you, but a new perspective can never hurt. In terms of projects, there\u0026rsquo;s a real joy in creating cool things, and a very real urge to show as many people as possible what you\u0026rsquo;ve created. I plan on making a post at least once every two weeks, but updating is likely to be erratic and based on the ebbs and flows of writing inspiration.\nMy Blogging Goals # Firstly, I want to consolidate my knowledge further by articulating and writing it a second time. As W. Edwards Deming said, \u0026ldquo;If you can\u0026rsquo;t describe what you\u0026rsquo;re doing as a process, then you don\u0026rsquo;t know what you\u0026rsquo;re doing.\u0026rdquo; Throughout my journey, I want to make sure I\u0026rsquo;m storing what I\u0026rsquo;ve learned in my inventory so they can help me with whatever the current opportunity is. By blogging, I should be able to recall what I learned from my past experiences easier. Why not social media? It simply isn\u0026rsquo;t a space catered for more formal thought or long ramblings, and you have little or control over your content.\nSecondly, In high school, I debated competitively almost every weekend. Even though I\u0026rsquo;m studying software, I still enjoy using my language skills (not programming languages) and I want to keep them sharp and put them to good use.\nI\u0026rsquo;m hoping that in half a year, there will be a wealth of ideas and a small community built around this website that enriches everyone\u0026rsquo;s lives. The internet can do great things for people, and many of them start at a low grassroots level like here.\nFinal Words # Every day, we have formative experiences that can change our worldview and improve who we are. This could be talking to a mentor, on the train, working in a team, or playing a video game. Many people know that these experiences can happen, and they do well in seeking out these experiences by leaving their comfort zone and doing new things.\nWhat may be slightly less common is really capturing these experiences. I believe that by living in the moment and being receptive, you can get conclusions and learn from even seemingly mundane events. Then, by writing these ideas down, you can retain them better and create something real that you have to follow, like a manifesto of sorts. For me, this blog is an outlet for my ideas to help me grow.\nFor you, it is hopefully a less mundane part of the mundanity of life and a place you can learn from.\n","date":"December 4, 2022","permalink":"/posts/first-post/","section":"Posts","summary":"Please read: this is not about relationships.","title":"Why We Should Be Together"},{"content":"","date":"January 1, 0001","permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"}]
